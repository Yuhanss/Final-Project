# Final-Project
## Description
In our lab, we are interested in one disease called CHARGE syndrome, which caused by mutating the CHD7 gene in patients. For normal cells, during the process of inducing neural crest cells(NCC) to form cranial mesenchymal cells(CMC), the shape of the nucleus of cells are changing, which may  related to the genome expression reorganization.  However, this nucleus shape changing does not appear in the CHARGE syndrome patient cells(G082 cell lines), and comes back in the CHD7 corrected cell lines. Therefore, we want to know whether the gene expression during the transition from NCC to CMC has any defects, by compare the RNA-seq data at day 0(NCC) and day 96(CMC) in both CHARGE patient cells, and corrected cells as control.

##Datasets
G082 and G082 corrected cell lines were both used to collect samples at day 0 (NCC) and day 96 (CMC), respectively, and sent to do the RNA-seq. G8082 corrected line is the control.

### Prototype
Analyze the first 100 genes that are specifically expressed in CMC.
